## Problem 1 Short Response Questions (20 pts)


1. Show that in vacuum, if the electric field vectors at all points point in the same direction, then the magnitude of the electric field must be uniform.

2. Prove that the vector field $\frac{\vec r}{r^3}$ is divergence-free and curl-free everywhere except at the origin. 
   You may either provide a direct vector-calculus proof or argue using known properties of electrostatic fields.

3. Faraday cage: similar to the phenomenon that signals get significantly weaker in elevators.
   
   (i) Explain why a person inside a vehicle usually remains safe when the car is struck by lightning during a thunderstorm.
   
   (ii) If a charged object is placed inside a Faraday cage, will it produce any effect outside the cage? Explain.

Label the four surfaces, from left to right, as $A, B, C, D$, where $A$ and $B$ are the left and right surface of the first (left) metal plate, and $C$ and $D$ are the left and right surface of the second (right) metal plate.

A coaxial cylindrical capacitor is formed by two conducting cylindrical shells whose common axis lies along the $y$-axis. The inner conductor has an inner radius $R_1$, and the outer conductor has an inner radius $R_2$. The space between the two conductors is filled with two linear dielectric materials of permittivities $\varepsilon_1$ and $\varepsilon_2$, which occupy the upper and lower halves, respectively, of the region between the cylinders. The outer conductor is grounded, and the inner conductor carries a (free) charge per unit length of $\lambda$.

**(2)** Consider a cylindrical conducting shell of radius $R$, whose axis coincides with the $y$-axis, and whose total charge is zero. A line of uniform charge density $\lambda$ is parallel to the axis of the cylinder, located at a distance $l$ from the axis ($l>R$), and lies in the $xOy$-plane. Find the surface charge density $\sigma(\theta)$ at a point on the conducting shell that makes an angle $\theta$ with the $xOy$-plane.

**(2)** A grounded conducting spherical shell has an inner radius $R$, with its center at the origin. A point electric dipole $\vec{p}$, oriented along the $x$-axis, is placed at the origin.
